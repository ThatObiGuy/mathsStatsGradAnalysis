## Introduction

This analysis focuses on graduates with a Level 8 degree in Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Statistics, examining trends in salary and prevalence of those who select 'other' for gender over the period captured in the data set.
```{r}
glimpse(gradMS)
head(gradMS)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
