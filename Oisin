#Introduction

#I am analysing gender pay gap later on in graduates careers (5-10 years psot graduation). This should provide us with an insight into how the gender pay gap changes with experince.

#This plot illustrates the gender pay gap comparing males and females who have graduated 5 to 10 years ago, providing a valuable insight into the pay gap later on in the career of graduates.
 From producing and analysing this plot it can be seen that the gender pay gap increases with males earning more than females as careers progress, ranging from a <1 percent difference to a >15 percent difference.
This gradual increase suggests that differences in pay may not only be consistent but also grow with time , showcasing gender based pay inequalities extending past entry level roles.
